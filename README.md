# discord.py-bot-boilerplate

This is a pretty basic boilerplate for discord.py bot. It features two example cogs as well.

The bot token is to be placed in a `.env` file in this format:

`BOT_TOKEN = <PLACE_TOKEN_HERE>`

Also check the branch [for_virtual_env](https://github.com/jarp0l/discord.py-bot-boilerplate/tree/for_virtual_env) for running the bot in virtual environment.

This template was heavily inspired by the neat and tidy code for [TryHackMe's discord bot](https://github.com/thm-community/thm-discord-bot/).
